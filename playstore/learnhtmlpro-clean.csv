It may not look as good as other apps, but the way they present information is easy to understand, easy to navigate, and detailed. To me, it feels more straightforward. I was using SoloLearn, which I do like, but the way the lessons were laid out was very confusing, jumping back and forth between concepts and not explaining other concepts well. The only thing I would suggest to improve this app is some kind of community that's accessible directly in the app.",130,Phone,1.3.7,positive,0.9989294409751892

The apps explains information really well while providing code with its output as well as the opportunity to edit the code and visualize the new output. This is very useful.

My main guide said tables were outdated but I totally disagree on that one point I find their so usfull... Thanks still browsing keep up the good work :3... CSS grid is ight I mean but to lay down a grid in mass for a board game or chess not limited to even 1px unit dice with the ""eventlistener"" as it'll call 1px...

f4b48f33-6eda-4f50-9773-79271597a6d6,Chris Gough,4,2023-09-23,Love this app and I've now paid for 3 of them. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because often on the Try it Yourself screen and while viewing the Output the top bar blocks the view of what you should be seeing. So sometimes it opens just to see a white empty page and it shouldn't be. Change that and I'll make it 5. Besides that I really like how this app was put together.

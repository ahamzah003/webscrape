jereld camphor,5,"August 23, 2020","It is an excellent app. It provides a practical learning path, through test-taking. I have completed the quiz-test. I now have a deeper understanding of html5 semantic tags and of how audios and videos are embedded in html. And, at the end, I was awarded a certificate in respect of successfully completing all the quizes. Thank you so much. J.",79,Phone
Harrison H,5,"October 30, 2020","So far I like the app a lot. It may not look as good as other apps, but the way they present information is easy to understand, easy to navigate, and detailed. To me, it feels more straightforward. I was using SoloLearn, which I do like, but the way the lessons were laid out was very confusing, jumping back and forth between concepts and not explaining other concepts well. The only thing I would suggest to improve this app is some kind of community that's accessible directly in the app.",130,Phone
Julio LH,4,"December 6, 2024","A great resource for learning HTML or brushing up your knowledge, with brief and clear explanations and practical exercises. It would be even better if the app was updated to include more recent features and best practices.",None,Phone
Cecile Perret,5,"October 19, 2020","I really like this app and its partner apps (css and javascript). For me, I like to learn and read and test things out. The apps explains information really well while providing code with its output as well as the opportunity to edit the code and visualize the new output. This is very useful. Of course learning requires some extra effort beyond passive reading, but coupled with note taking and expanding on the definitions online if needed can really yield long-term learning effects.",40,Phone
Cathy Furman,4,"February 19, 2023","App works well, some bugs here and there with the ""try it yourself"", but it doesnt break the learning for me. The questions are mostly a bit too easy in the quizes, maybe a few interactive questions would be nice. Overall the info and explanations are good and straight forward.",17,Phone
Daniel Dolan,5,"May 20, 2020","Very easy and simple way of learning HTML5. Fantastic as a previous Web dev who's been out of the field for quite a number of years. Great way for beginners and returning developers to learn/re-learn html, CSS and Java.",18,Phone
Diego Schelling,5,"December 31, 2020","Great experience with this app. I have pretty much 0 experience with any sort of coding. It is user friendly and super easy to understand. Before you move on to Javascript, start with HTML and CSS.",29,Phone
A Google user,5,"April 27, 2020",So far this app has been excellent in teaching the essentials of html- I am using it to revise what I'd learnt way back. I like the way it frequently uses the try it yourself editor and has short quizzes to test your knowledge as you go. Definitely worth the money and is great not to have any annoying ads.,2,Phone
Sirena E,5,"November 24, 2022",Great app and I learned even more about html than I knew before. I would like to suggest if we could have the option to choose a different font when I get my certificate. Other than that everything about this app is great ! Highly recommend.,2,Phone
Augusto Pietroski,5,"May 6, 2020","The most addictive programming learning app of all times!! It's simple but very direct and straight to the point.

Mckinley Abiera,5,"September 3, 2021",It's very nice app that's really helps users to learn a lot about creating their own website. It explained well every single details.

SL Guitar Lessons,5,"July 16, 2022",So far great. One should know mobile browser experience is way different than a pc or a Mac though (or a Linux machine if that's your thing) I guess you will miss everything that's intended for the mouse when it comes to examples,7,Phone

Chris Gough,4,"September 23, 2023",Love this app and I've now paid for 3 of them. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because often on the Try it Yourself screen and while viewing the Output the top bar blocks the view of what you should be seeing. So sometimes it opens just to see a white empty page and it shouldn't be. Change that and I'll make it 5. Besides that I really like how this app was put together. Thank you.,None,Tablet
